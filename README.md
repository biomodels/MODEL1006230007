Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/MODEL1006230007.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/MODEL1006230007.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import MODEL1006230007 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Teaching from classic papers: Hill's model of muscle contraction.**   
Holmes JW. _Adv Physiol Educ_ 2006 Jun;30(2):67-72
[16709736](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16709736) ,  
**Abstract:**   
A. V. Hill's 1938 paper "The heat of shortening and the dynamic constants of
muscle" is an enduring classic, presenting detailed methods, meticulous
experiments, and the model of muscle contraction that now bears Hill's name.
Pairing a simulation based on Hill's model with a reading of his paper allows
students to follow his thought process to discover key principles of muscle
physiology and gain insight into how to develop quantitative models of
physiological processes. In this article, the experience of the author using
this approach in a graduate biomedical engineering course is outlined, along
with suggestions for adapting this approach to other audiences.

This model was taken from the [CellML
repository](http://www.cellml.org/models) and automatically converted to SBML.  
The original model was: [ **Holmes JW. (2006) - version=1.0**
](http://models.cellml.org/exposure/d40159fdd9f577e87c6d786abcd6ce6c)  
The original CellML model was created by:  
**Paul Harrington**
