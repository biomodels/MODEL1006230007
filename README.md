**Abstract:**   
A. V. Hill's 1938 paper "The heat of shortening and the dynamic constants of
muscle" is an enduring classic, presenting detailed methods, meticulous
experiments, and the model of muscle contraction that now bears Hill's name.
Pairing a simulation based on Hill's model with a reading of his paper allows
students to follow his thought process to discover key principles of muscle
physiology and gain insight into how to develop quantitative models of
physiological processes. In this article, the experience of the author using
this approach in a graduate biomedical engineering course is outlined, along
with suggestions for adapting this approach to other audiences.
